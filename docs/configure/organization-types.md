# Organization Types

[Organization Types] are classifications that you may assign to an [Organization].  [Organization Types] also have their own (optional) field layout
that can be configured.   

An [Organization] can be assigned to none, one or many [Organization Types].  In addition, the associated [Organization Types] can be sorted to establish priority.

Common examples of [Organization Types] are:
* Industries: Agriculture, Education, Food, Manufacturing, Real Estate
* Association Tiers: Basic, Standard, Advanced, Lifetime
* Membership Tiers: Company revenue, Employee count, etc.

### Examples
Spark Technologies is a Fortune 500 company. They sponsor (an [Organization Type]) an annual conference in exchange for advertising placement and their logo featured on various pages throughout the site.
Since this sponsorship requires a company logo, a special field layout is created to reflect the requirements.  Managing the Organization is intuitive because only the applicable fields are available for content publishing.

::: tip Notice
You may opt to classify [Organizations] using a [Category] or other relation which is acceptable.  The suggested use of [Organization Types] occurs when tailored fields or sortable classifications are needed.
